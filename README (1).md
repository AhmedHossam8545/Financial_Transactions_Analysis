## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Overview

I designed **three dashboards** to visualize findings clearly:

### 1️⃣ Overview Dashboard
- Shows **total spending ($19.26M)**, **average spending ($42.8)**, **average customer age (54.03)**, and **transaction volume (450K)**  
- Spending trends by **year** and **month**  

### 2️⃣ Customers Dashboard
- Spending & transactions by **gender** (almost balanced: 51% Male, 49% Female)  
- Transaction types (swipe & chip dominate; online is underutilized)  
- Age distribution (60+ is the most active group, 20–30 underrepresented)  

### 3️⃣ Cards Dashboard
- Card type usage (Debit: 62%, Credit: 31%, Prepaid: 7%)  
- Chip card adoption (90%)  
- Card brand distribution (**Mastercard & Visa dominate**)  
- Spending by number of cards (peaks at **4 cards = $4.9M**)

## 🔍 Business Insights

From the dashboards:

- **Gender Spending** → Balanced between males & females → wide market engagement.  
- **Transaction Types** → Traditional methods dominate; **online underutilized** → growth opportunity.  
- **Card Usage** → Debit most common, but **credit drives higher spending**.  
- **Card Brands** → Mastercard & Visa dominate; Amex & Discover marginal.  
- **Number of Cards** → Customers with **3–4 cards drive most spending**.  
- **Trends Over Time** → Steady growth until 2016 → decline after.  
- **Seasonality** → Peaks in **March, August, October**.  
- **Customer Age** → **60+ group is most active** → younger customers underrepresented.  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Apply **machine learning models** to predict spending patterns.  
- Detect **fraudulent transactions** using anomaly detection.  
- Expand dashboards with **geographical analysis** (if data available).
